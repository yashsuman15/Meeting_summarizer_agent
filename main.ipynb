So corporate events, they, I think I saw a little, I put this in Slack and I </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">saw a little bit of kind of noise around it, which was good. The nutshell here is as we've kind of </span>            <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">restructured and tried different things. The event support that we need isn't as nailed down as it needs to </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">be. So the current tactic that we're going with is go-to-market team, signs up and kind of sponsors that </span>      <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">event. So you support as a PMM, your campaign manager does the campaigns for that event, etc, etc. I don't </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",

So I guess the next, so it looks like tie put in some </span>      <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">folks. It looks like this looks good so that let's see needs support from GTM teams. So I guess the ask would</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">be to work with your GTM teams.

So to be back, I got one person to respond so far. So it may end up Cindy being you and I</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">set? Yeah, we're on like the two week cadence. Okay.

So it looks like maybe a platform on reinvent, CICD on </span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">Google Next and Gidops on CUBECON, does that sound right? Yeah. Yeah, that's where we were last I heard. </span>      <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">Cool, so then I think we can help the Corp events team. They do a lot of like a cat hurting and keep on </span>       <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">get the commitment specifically from your campaign managers, hey, we're signing up for CUBECON.

       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">we'll get some amount of press attention because we're having an event, right?

       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">we make?

So the thought here is to, but also because our entire road map is </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">completely public and because we shift these tiny little MVCs, a new feature will come out but it'll be not </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",

So if you look back over the past year and say okay, like what </span>     <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">was we just had 14.0. Can we just reuse some of those things and plug them in here? Absolutely, yeah. Yeah, </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">and vulnerability management was one of the features out of, we looked at 14.0. So I think, yeah, this is </span>     <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">like let's take the stuff from 14.0 and then maybe add a few more so that we can hit kind of different areas </span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">of press or give RPR team. This is kind of like input into RPR team to give them fodder to go out with. And </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">are we trying to hit three per stage? Yeah, ideally there's just three, you know, three at a time per stage </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">and then I think y'all made some good notes that, okay, we need to add manage. So I see manage in here that's</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">excellent. And integrations, we don't well actually we have some pretty exciting integrations. So we have </span>     <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">the. The Jira stuff is pretty good. There's a couple of things in integrations with VS code that could be </span>     <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">notable, but I can I show what I did for SCM just to get some general feedback on it and if someone hasn't </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">done it, maybe that'll also kick right. I was going in simplest direction here, which was thinking you know, </span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">a lot of then I called them key iterations, the sort of specific things. So I listed a few specific things </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">like three or four per each as key iterations, but I called them something overall. So we have like one thing</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">to call them. There's several key iterations aligned with Gettily cluster, several that roll up to a research</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">based user experience. And I was thinking like I was shy on calling out UX as a bucket except that actually </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">that's that's super typical. Like Windows 11 or anybody who's rolling stuff out, they almost always have UX </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">as one of their three things. And then they mentioned a longer list of stuff that aligns to that. So I you </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">know, forgave myself for doing something at first. I was kind of like shy about calling out UX and bucketing </span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">some things there, but actually when I looked around, that's pretty much how everybody does a big launch. And</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">in terms of the excitement level, that also like I went in thinking this is just a two. I guess part of it is</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">like I feel like we're almost fixing something that's broken. And that's not something you want to shout from</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">the rooftops about, but actually some of that stuff is really cool. So I gave it a three excitement level. I </span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">wasn't sure exactly where to place things, but I figured I wouldn't like the Cindy's comment have something </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">that's a one here anyway. But I the only way I could make sense of like the iterations was to bucket them as </span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">something. And so that's kind of how I came down on it. I don't know what I don't think about that. I've done</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">a similar I've taken a similar approach for monitor with incident management. There were a bunch of things </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">that we released, although the core of incident management was part of 12.x, I think. So I did the same. I </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">think that makes sense. Yeah, that would help me with the plan stuff as well, because there are some things </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">like Epic boards that people have been asking for for years now, and they finally have. And that's great. But</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">I think like the milestone burn-up charts, that was a two. And that's helpful. I was looking through features</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">and actual monthly features that were released in a given month. I mean, that was one of the more important </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">ones, but it's not very exciting, but we can bundle that with some other things and and and up level it. So </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">that that would be helpful there. And also, Brian about the VS code thing. One other cool thing about that is</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">both of those VS code integrations that hit the same month were community contributions, which is also kind </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">of cool. Is that is do we have VS code listed on here? I didn't add it, but I can add that in. I've got good </span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">notes on that. The extension that had been around for a while became official. It was kind of one of the </span>      <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">things, but there's some other stuff that's a little juicier than that. And that I think that's a that's a </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">pretty good note as well. We did that with like our our Terraform module, right? There was like a community </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">module, but now it's officially supported. So that's that's the you know that can be the line, yes or no, </span>     <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">whether you can use the thing for a lot of businesses. So I think that's a good one to you. How are we </span>        <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">measuring excitement levels? One, two, and three. Is there? I was I was looking at maybe MAU as a metric to </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">perhaps measure whether customers have started using that are interested in using that or not. We probably </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">may not have it for everything, but at least some of it wherever we have it is it's probably something we can</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">we can use. But we of course we need a benchmark level of what MAU we want to call one two three. I think </span>     <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">it's a little it's a little bit of a judgment call like um you know, for example, Kormack was saying like </span>     <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">epic boards is something that was asked for for a long time. Now depending on how it's asked for maybe that </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">means it's exciting or it's not, right? But usually when something it's a lot of upvotes or when there's a </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">lot of demand for it, then I would I would bump the excitement level on something like that. Certainly it's </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">something shifted a lot of people are using it, the MAU that's like that's another good measure. I don't know</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">that any one of those needs to kind of be exclusive. I think it's a bit of a it's a bit of an individual </span>      <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">judgment call on just like what is what is your feeling based on you know, could be anecdotal like you talk </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">to customers and they're like really hyper excited about this.

       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">I think it's okay. I first responded to my comment about why we have the low excitement ones and just said </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">something about having them sort of stack ranked. Yeah I might I might even constrain this is we're not going</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">to highlight low assignments but we want to see the full spectrum especially in the case we have slim </span>         <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">pickings alternatively. If there are double digit entries then we can stack rank. So that's that's kind of </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">also helpful there. So if we have three for all of these that I mean it looks like we're going to get there </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">and that's going to be quite a lot of features. So I might constrain it like this maybe you can only give out</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">one one two or three and and treat as a stack rank rather than just like a raw excitement level that doesn't </span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",

Sami you have some questions here for Alita. So in the competitive sheet I was I mean </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">I've already identified the features for CD configers as well as monitor. Getting it reviewed from PM my </span>      <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">guess was or my understanding was that we wouldn't have the same set of competitors that we want to compare </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">to but the right competitors for that particular stage right so for example for for monitor we may not have </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">like a GitHub or something like that we would have monitor based competitors. Or was that the understanding </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">because we identified that entire list of competitors and partners for every single stage. I thought we were </span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">going to be using those competitors to compare against so I just wanted your your input on what because I saw</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">some of you have compared with the five competitors already listed over there. So they may not be relevant </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">for example cloud beats may not be relevant for monitor stage at all so that's what I wanted to check it </span>      <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">through. Yeah that's the case I need to go back and look at this spreadsheet I mean if the competitor does </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">not apply for that particular stage they shouldn't be on that tab and spreadsheet. So are you saying that you</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">see competitors on that tab for a stage where they don't apply. Yeah I think it was copy pasted each rule has</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">the same. Yeah so each sheet has has a DO at last year in GitHub Jenkins J for all of them cloud these right </span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">so that may not be relevant for monitor for configure it would be a different set of competitors that we need</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">to include which I think we already identified a while back I think we identified top three competitors for </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">every stage. Yeah that's when we tiered it right tier one tier two two three so this this where we are right </span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">now is we're looking at just tier one competitors that's probably why I cut and paste them because those are </span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">all tier ones. So we're just focusing on tier one right now so if they don't apply to that stage don't worry </span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">about it make sense. So just pick the ones out of that list that apply to our stage. Right I think we just </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">use the tier one competitors and if they're not if they don't are not applicable then we don't have to fill </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">out anything for that. Yeah for now but then we'll move to tier two and tier three then we'll look at those </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">other. Do we need to add a line item for GitLab as well because I think that's the same over here. Yeah we </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">should add a I think you asked me that before right or someone asked me. I'm just looking at it Brian asked. </span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">Yeah we can. Yeah because the way without it you're basically putting all the things that we're better at. </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">Yeah for sure for sure. Yeah right so ideally when we picked like the 10 to 15 features those some of those </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">were like GitLab only some of those were like GitLab didn't have. Well I thought it was supposed to be none </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">of them should be GitLab only right it should be all through the lens of. Yeah yeah exactly yeah it should be</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">like market lens so an ideal world most of them are like this is what I'm shopping for the solution. Some </span>     <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">like some of them might be GitLab only some of them might be like competitor only so that it's a somebody </span>     <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">would look at it and be like this looks honest and trustworthy and like an accurate assessment of the market.</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">Yeah yeah yeah yeah. And then yeah I think Simon for this just to kind of reiterate for this one we're only </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">doing these five competitors so we'll do the other ones in a later stage and then. For if if the vendor </span>       <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">builds like bills themselves as a platform then we should specifically call out that they have zero so </span>        <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">GitHub.

       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">they all do for tier one except Jenkins and Cloudbees yeah. Yeah Jenkins Cloudbees does not. Yeah right. But </span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">what is it you know Azure DevOps GitHub Atlassian and although Atlassians we still need to figure something </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">out there. That is a matter of fact that I go back and add Atlassian because like based on conversation I </span>     <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">think we have to do it. I don't think we can leave them off. You know I don't like to look at this version. </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">It is Atlassian is on that sheet. Okay yeah I went back and added them because based on a discussion like my </span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">my I wanted to take them off completely and just leave them as a partner but we can't do that. So yeah so for</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">for those platform you know we should call out the fact that they don't have any monitoring. If they have </span>     <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">like zero out of 15 we should call that out. Same with configure stuff for this you know any those kind of </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">capabilities. Maybe I think if we took that step further it would be good to even describe it in a way that </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">doesn't just say our product stage and use like a value based description of what monitor and configure mean </span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",

And here's the one for the platform players. So we made it we</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">made a couple decisions along the way so one of the decisions was to just go with stages. It would have been </span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">like a whole nother layer of okay if we don't go with just the GitLab stages the 10 stages. What do we use? </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",

The way this is getting built is off of a data model. In </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">theory these could change or be updated where the underlying data remains the same. We're separating like </span>     <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">presentation layer from data layer. So that's it's not going to be as hard to update in the future as it </span>      <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">currently is where it's a mess of spaghetti code and it's like really really difficult to update. And then </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">the other component is then not in this iteration we need to get something live but in the next iteration </span>     <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">you'll click on verify and it'll go down to the list of the 15 features. And that's where you can describe </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">what the heck of verify is or what the heck I managed. Okay, so we will have an opportunity because I was </span>     <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">about to say you're going to hate me for this but like we're. We're being sick of cool about the same problem</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">we had which being the audience coming in and not knowing anything about these specific stages. Yeah, that </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">was one of the big things it's like okay 15 15 features what what is what are they why do I care you know. </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">They're kind of better yeah. To say that means nothing to me looking at this this page. But quick question. </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">Not going to be a Debbie downer. No, we're on top of that. I actually if you read the thread I brought that </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">up but she said we can't do it like right now which I understand. But small thing what do you guys think </span>      <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">about the colors. Uh-huh. No, no. I usually let the designers handle that stuff they they. I like. I like the</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">fact that there's no red on that. Oh, you like that. That's what I was going for. Well, you like that. Okay. </span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">It's not it's not obviously negative. So we're saying because it really does lend itself to being a </span>           <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">comparison more than a competitive piece because of that because there's no you know these folks at 37% are </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">in the red and they're terrible. They just have less green or we would have less green. So that it's not it's</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">not being worse. It's being less good. I think that lends itself to. Working with you know all the co-op </span>      <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">petition situations we were talking about. Yeah. Yeah, that's that's a goal is we want we want to generate a </span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">helpful asset for the industry. This is not just like marketing shill. This should be like a helpful page. </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">Uh, so it's like yeah the goals have a comparison comparing DevOps tools. Not a you know this is all of our </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">competitors and why we're better. Yeah. Um, I think it's from a competitive mindset. And for me, I'm like, </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">let's go hard. Let's put some rent on there and call. That's just the way I think right. So, but I'm going to</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">stick with the green. They recommended we stick with the green and see how it goes. But I don't know. I was </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">feeling the red and yellow too. So it is easy on the eyes. You know, there's something to be said to that. </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">So. Yeah. Cool. Well, we're almost up on time, but I did want to share one thing that kind of came in. Like, </span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">basically Friday. It was like late Thursday for me. So this. This is another thing a lot of these things that</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">don't have like a ton of context on. I just know like we're just trying to up our game. So like, hey, let's </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">move fast and do the best we can do. So this is a little bit of a messaging framework. And then the </span>           <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">assignment that was given to me was to fill in these boxes here. So. And then this was the father that I got.</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">So there was these ones that said like from roadmap to company vision, we are transparent. And a single </span>       <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">source of truth countless possibilities. Honestly, I think this ones are like really pithy and catchy. I </span>      <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">really like it. I really liked what's the other one that I like that not everyone does. All in one for </span>        <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">everyone. So I just, I don't know, I like I just think so. There's something catchy about that. But I know </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">that kind of catchy is not everyone's cup of tea. All that's to say is the assignment here was that I took it</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">was to write a pithy few words like punchy statement for each of these three things. So I ended up with a </span>     <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">single source of truth countless possibilities. I liked that a lot. This one I went with end to end control </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">over your software factory. Not as pithy but or like not as catchy. But I think. I like it. What's the </span>        <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">difference between that slide and the next one that doesn't have anything under security? This was the </span>        <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">honestly so that so when I first got this, it didn't have this and it didn't have anything under security. So</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">this is like, it's your iteration of it. Yeah, this is this is mine. This is I just put here so that I would </span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">have like the original statements like, you know, automate nearly anything, collaborate on everything. I kind</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">of like that, but I, you know, this one I hate, scale up speed up, test up. I don't think anybody tests up. I</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">think that's really goofy. So hate it. This one I love. That's for me. It's I love it or hate it, right? I </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">love how I love that you're just like bam. So anyway, the what I love in just in five minutes now and then we</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">can kind of end the call is kind of like. Anything that you would change this out for anything that you would</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">change this out for. And then actually let's start here. This one I couldn't pick. And I'll tell you why it's</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">because I like things to have parity in their tone. Right. So this is maybe like super nuanced elements of </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">messaging, but I hate it if it's like a single source of truth that's like in noun phrase and the end control</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">that's like a noun item. So you could say with GitLab, you get a single source of truth with GitLab, you get </span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">and the end control. And you can't say with GitLab, you get move fast with confidence. No, but you can say </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">more speedless risk. I like that one the best. I don't like the last one. I agree. That's that's why I put </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">this one at top was for that parity. And then so it sounds like kind of y'all's thoughts are that's that's </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">good as well. Yeah, the only thing it might be missing, but I don't know how we do it without over </span>            <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">complicating it is. Well, I guess less risk also implies higher quality. I guess that kind of bundles the </span>     <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">quality and the security together. So I've talked myself out of not liking that. So yeah, good. Cindy's last </span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">blog post had a really good turn of phrase that I stole for forgive that 14 when she was out. It was like </span>     <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">secure the software factory and all the stuff that you're making.

Secure the software factory and it's deliverables. Yeah, I thought it was good to emphasize </span>     <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">both because they mean that it's missing. Yeah. Yeah, so you could say secure and control your software </span>       <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">factory and it's deliverables. Maybe that would encompass both thoughts. I'm not a big fan of the it's </span>        <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">deliverables. Is there a can we say like your software factory and your software or your product product </span>      <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">sounds like car manufacturer? I could say IP here, but it just doesn't sound right. And that's always to </span>      <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">always short hand. Yeah, I like this one better. Yeah, I think I do too. But but I appreciate the thought. </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">Ryan. Uh, and then the last thing I'll say is so this is this was my first time in the last year. I think </span>     <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">this was my attempt to to channel my inner ash withers. Um, I think ash is like super good at just again, </span>     <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">just like the catchier, like the turn of phrase element to it. And so like this kind of idea, like single </span>     <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">source of truth countless possibilities. Or all in one for everyone, there's something catchy about this. So </span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">here I was trying to like envision what is it that we actually give you with this velocity? It's like, it's </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">velocity with confidence is what is what you get. I like your move fast with confidence better than increase </span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">speed and stay on track. Yeah, so I was trying to I was thinking of like, you know, if you're like, if you're</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">in a race car and like you go like super super fast, like let's say you're in the bike race, right? And </span>       <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">you're going so fast and somebody holds out the sign and then like half of the bike race collapses. It's </span>      <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">easier. Right. So it's almost kind of like you can you can keep going like faster and faster and faster. And </span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">if somebody like jumps out with a sign in the middle of the racetrack, you're not going to get tripped up by </span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">it because Git Labs, you know, it's testing is going to catch that. It's security is going to catch that. All</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">of those elements that allow you to move faster but to do so with confidence. Because otherwise you're like </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">the faster you go, then it gets more dangerous. So trying to encapsulate that in this like that was kind of </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">where I was like stay on track, but I didn't like it either. Did you just open the door for a NASCAR </span>          <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">partnership? NASCAR goes fast in terms of left because of Git Lab. You're a new Ricky. So yeah, so I don't </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">think I like that one. And then I think between these two, I like to move fast with confidence, but I don't </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">like the the verbiage of it because it doesn't have parity. So that's where I think. Do you want to add maybe</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">we can add high confidence or more confidence at the end of your first statement. So it kind of combines all </span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">of it. So more speed less risk high confidence. But this is kind of overused anyway. Like I see a lot of </span>      <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">competitors of vendors using it. I really like the first one. Just more speed less risk. Bam, no trade offs, </span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">you know, just this is how it is. Oh, no trade offs. I don't know. That's one of my go-to's. I love that one.</span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">This gets into the no trade offs. The engineer in me says, there's never no trade offs. That's like saying </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">like 100% secure. Complete. This is why we always say mitigate, right? We always feel at risk or less risk. </span>   <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">You never say no. You never say no. You're late with messaging, right? I mean, not everything, you know. How </span>  <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">about just more speed less risk with confidence? What? Yeah. More speed. The Ricky Bobby and me really did </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>  <span style=\"color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00\">like the no trade off. So that's Parker. Yeah. Oh, is that was that from? No, but it could have been. It's </span>    <span style=\"color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080\">│</span>\n",

      " can record. And we don't have a ton of items to get to. And I might be able to do one that might be fun if we have a little bit of time. So corporate events, they, I think I saw a little, I put this in Slack and I saw a little bit of kind of noise around it, which was good. The nutshell here is as we've kind of restructured and tried different things. The event support that we need isn't as nailed down as it needs to be. So the current tactic that we're going with is go-to-market team, signs up and kind of sponsors that event. So you support as a PMM, your campaign manager does the campaigns for that event, etc, etc. I don't see anyone in the, maybe there are comments in the issue. I don't see the header updated yet. I thought we had in Slack sort of farm to each one of them out. So I guess the next, so it looks like tie put in some folks. It looks like this looks good so that let's see needs support from GTM teams. So I guess the ask would be to work with your GTM teams. So let me ask, I saw some Slack, I think in our Slack, but did you all, were you all able to connect with your GTM teams? On Slack only and on the issue actually. Yeah, so I'm not in real time for that. So to be back, I got one person to respond so far. So it may end up Cindy being you and I just picked the one that we want to do and then they can back us up. If we don't get any more feedback. Yeah, do you all, does anybody have like a regular sink still? Are those all been canceled or is there a separate set? Yeah, we're on like the two week cadence. Okay. Yeah, Gidops has been canceled after the enablement. Cool, so I'm just trying to catch up with the thread. So it looks like maybe a platform on reinvent, CICD on Google Next and Gidops on CUBECON, does that sound right? Yeah. Yeah, that's where we were last I heard. Cool, so then I think we can help the Corp events team. They do a lot of like a cat hurting and keep on tracking people down. So I think if this team can take the mission to try to help track that down. So if you get the commitment specifically from your campaign managers, hey, we're signing up for CUBECON. Can you comment on the issue that yes, I can commit to this, etc, etc, etc. So that just so that they can get that event support. But that looks good and I appreciate thanks for the link to SOMI on the rolls. Product announcements. So I appreciate bride for adding this. I probably should have added it, but I had two questions about that one. One is over what time frame are we looking at? So in theory, this could be the same as the GILEP 14 lunch where we're saying basically since 13.0, what kind of big improvements have we made? Can't believe this is always a little bit tough and I'm not totally sure of all of the kind of the interplay here. But I think this is kind of the general gist of this assignment is okay, we have commit coming up. We have some amount of like we have a stage of you know a metaphorical stage to say something to the world and we'll get some amount of press attention because we're having an event, right? What kind of announcements do we make? At GILEP, it's really, really tough to make product announcements because our entire road map is completely public. Yadda, yadda, yadda. So the thought here is to, but also because our entire road map is completely public and because we shift these tiny little MVCs, a new feature will come out but it'll be not really usable, right? So it takes a while. So if you look back over the past year and say okay, like what started in the last year but now is really like a full-fledged feature, what would be coming out of beta, right? Like if we were any other company, when we started a beta program in this last year, what would be announcing is GA at commit? That's kind of my thought on it. I see a couple of head now. What do you think Sydney? Yeah, I think I was inclined to group some things to say like vulnerability management because there were tiny little MVCs all the way along but if you look at over the course of the year, we went from this to this, it makes more sense to me to highlight that than any individual little thing and then the other point was we just had 14.0. Can we just reuse some of those things and plug them in here? Absolutely, yeah. Yeah, and vulnerability management was one of the features out of, we looked at 14.0. So I think, yeah, this is like let's take the stuff from 14.0 and then maybe add a few more so that we can hit kind of different areas of press or give RPR team. This is kind of like input into RPR team to give them fodder to go out with. And are we trying to hit three per stage? Yeah, ideally there's just three, you know, three at a time per stage and then I think y'all made some good notes that, okay, we need to add manage. So I see manage in here that's excellent. And integrations, we don't well actually we have some pretty exciting integrations. So we have the. The Jira stuff is pretty good. There's a couple of things in integrations with VS code that could be notable, but I can I show what I did for SCM just to get some general feedback on it and if someone hasn't done it, maybe that'll also kick right. I was going in simplest direction here, which was thinking you know, a lot of then I called them key iterations, the sort of specific things. So I listed a few specific things like three or four per each as key iterations, but I called them something overall. So we have like one thing to call them. There's several key iterations aligned with Gettily cluster, several that roll up to a research based user experience. And I was thinking like I was shy on calling out UX as a bucket except that actually that's that's super typical. Like Windows 11 or anybody who's rolling stuff out, they almost always have UX as one of their three things. And then they mentioned a longer list of stuff that aligns to that. So I you know, forgave myself for doing something at first. I was kind of like shy about calling out UX and bucketing some things there, but actually when I looked around, that's pretty much how everybody does a big launch. And in terms of the excitement level, that also like I went in thinking this is just a two. I guess part of it is like I feel like we're almost fixing something that's broken. And that's not something you want to shout from the rooftops about, but actually some of that stuff is really cool. So I gave it a three excitement level. I wasn't sure exactly where to place things, but I figured I wouldn't like the Cindy's comment have something that's a one here anyway. But I the only way I could make sense of like the iterations was to bucket them as something. And so that's kind of how I came down on it. I don't know what I don't think about that. I've done a similar I've taken a similar approach for monitor with incident management. There were a bunch of things that we released, although the core of incident management was part of 12.x, I think. So I did the same. I think that makes sense. Yeah, that would help me with the plan stuff as well, because there are some things like Epic boards that people have been asking for for years now, and they finally have. And that's great. But I think like the milestone burn-up charts, that was a two. And that's helpful. I was looking through features and actual monthly features that were released in a given month. I mean, that was one of the more important ones, but it's not very exciting, but we can bundle that with some other things and and and up level it. So that that would be helpful there. And also, Brian about the VS code thing. One other cool thing about that is both of those VS code integrations that hit the same month were community contributions, which is also kind of cool. Is that is do we have VS code listed on here? I didn't add it, but I can add that in. I've got good notes on that. The extension that had been around for a while became official. It was kind of one of the things, but there's some other stuff that's a little juicier than that. And that I think that's a that's a pretty good note as well. We did that with like our our Terraform module, right? There was like a community module, but now it's officially supported. So that's that's the you know that can be the line, yes or no, whether you can use the thing for a lot of businesses. So I think that's a good one to you. How are we measuring excitement levels? One, two, and three. Is there? I was I was looking at maybe MAU as a metric to perhaps measure whether customers have started using that are interested in using that or not. We probably may not have it for everything, but at least some of it wherever we have it is it's probably something we can we can use. But we of course we need a benchmark level of what MAU we want to call one two three. I think it's a little it's a little bit of a judgment call like um you know, for example, Kormack was saying like epic boards is something that was asked for for a long time. Now depending on how it's asked for maybe that means it's exciting or it's not, right? But usually when something it's a lot of upvotes or when there's a lot of demand for it, then I would I would bump the excitement level on something like that. Certainly it's something shifted a lot of people are using it, the MAU that's like that's another good measure. I don't know that any one of those needs to kind of be exclusive. I think it's a bit of a it's a bit of an individual judgment call on just like what is what is your feeling based on you know, could be anecdotal like you talk to customers and they're like really hyper excited about this. Or you know, maybe not which is which is okay. I think it's okay. I first responded to my comment about why we have the low excitement ones and just said something about having them sort of stack ranked. Yeah I might I might even constrain this is we're not going to highlight low assignments but we want to see the full spectrum especially in the case we have slim pickings alternatively. If there are double digit entries then we can stack rank. So that's that's kind of also helpful there. So if we have three for all of these that I mean it looks like we're going to get there and that's going to be quite a lot of features. So I might constrain it like this maybe you can only give out one one two or three and and treat as a stack rank rather than just like a raw excitement level that doesn't necessarily. Hard to somebody's one or somebody's three maybe more important than somebody else's one. I agree. And I had I started by just looking at what was considered a key feature over the past year from from create and you know there are at least a dozen things that I'm not mentioning that could be on the list like I could give you 10 things instead of three. Yeah give it give this just like the rough like pass and like a lot of things recently I've been moving between docs and spreadsheet and the spreadsheet to docs. This you know this might this might end up or some iteration of this might end up in a spreadsheet where we then try to stack rank in PR is like okay out of all of like the you know there's maybe 10 boxes here in three each out of the 30 items which are the top five. Actually let's just let's actually just do that let's just do this like top top five overall. This one is a PR driven to some degree. What about like the new Pencristy's product keynote at commit are we telling this with that? So this is exactly where this is headed to is the idea that during the product keynote and then ideally during kit sits keynote as well that there's some level of like an announcement that we make that then the press cares about that announcement. Again really tough to do at Get Lab because it's all been around for a while so this is this is our attempt ahead to that area is to say like these are the announcements of the event and yeah maybe it's some things that have been around for a while but like now they're at a level of maturity now you know there's there's a reason to be excited about this so that's kind of where it's coming from. So I put a top five overall maybe we can just you know we should reserve a spot for plan but I'm gonna have to go through and do some aggregating after this just go through the list of what shipped in the last 12 months and re-buck at that. So maybe we can do like five minutes kind of like just just time box and kind of look at these here. What do you all think is a top would be a top five out of the list of you know 20 or 30 I would say if UX does end up being a flag that we fly that's an easy one because there's more than just maps to the create stage that would be considered UX improvement. Okay. What else? We need to have a security one in there we could have either vulnerability management or I was when I've been struggling with a little bit as I'd like to kind of group the some of this the proprietary scanning without making it sound like they're scanning improvements because that sounds like they weren't good before. Yeah. Let's go with vulnerability management for now. I now would agree on that. One and I would say that some of these we did do some press around and the the fuzzing acquisitions was one thing so we might not get it out of that. That's kind of old. I was I mean we did the fuzzing acquisitions a long time ago. Was it within the past year or longer? I thought it was within the past year. I think it was in the last little over six months or so. It was last summer right? It was like last spring or summer and then we did another set of press around the integration of it because the PR team liked all the I mean we got a lot of attention on the acquisition so they had me do a follow-up on the integration. I just feel like it's kind of worn out now. Right that's what I was saying is that the fuzzing we already did press on through probably we'll not get another chump at that so I think let's go with vulnerability management. Unreviewed is that we also have in terms of proprietary stuff we've also got we replaced one of our scanners with SEMGRIP and we did we have our own proprietary DAST scanner now that's in it's in beta called brow zirker so it's our answer to scanning single-page applications which represent a unique challenge. I think I mean if I could have to it would be vulnerability management and brow zirker probably. Okay SEMGRIP that get picked up as a online item in a couple of pieces about get back 14. Which between between the proprietary ships of the vulnerability management which would you pick as number one out of those two? Probably vulnerability management. Okay. I'm just kind of scanning the list I would probably say like Kubernetes agent is something that we've made a lot of investment in although I think the Kubernetes agent and from an integration point of view perhaps the data form integration I think we have a lot of customers actually using that already. So I'm going to agree I'm just going to call those get ops and I'm going to put like KS agent plus SCEP or integrations. It's like a bucket of capabilities that is probably worth talking about. Well let's you know let's try to this is due Tuesday I think we want to try to get this done. So maybe just review this kind of like let's just kind of pick top five maybe something from plan and something from CI CD. That plan editor's definitely an option for CI CD. Yeah there might be a sorry no sorry there might be a value-strimanal Linux story in there too. If we aggregate it all it's a bummer that customizable value-strimanal Linux is 12.9 but yeah there might be. Cool now I'm just going to I'm going to ping you on this car back to add a top five plan. Cool I think Man it's a pretty heavy pretty heavy list just looking at it you know it's pretty cool. Yeah that's great. Yeah and this is something we don't do which I I agree like we don't we don't often stop as a company and just kind of look at our wins. I was really I don't did you all did anybody miss what do we call it? Assembly the assembly? If you missed it I recommend it I laugh because like what assembly reminds me of it like when I was in like a young child in grade school. Yeah you they'd have this big stack of like carpet they're like squares of carpet and you go like you go into the gym and you pull off this a square of carpet and all the children would sit on a square of carpet and that was like you'd have an assembly. Yeah so that's what I'm going to do. Put everyone in the gym or like convert the half cafeteria gym you know take away the big barrier between it so that we can have more room and then take those carpet that have never been cleaned and just you know sit on them and it'll be great. Aside from the goofy name I thought that and of course we can't talk about any of it on YouTube but man that was like a really awesome look back at like here's some wins and here's some exciting things that we've done. And so I think we just need to get better at this as a company I think this exercise and opportunity that I think we do a little bit of that but this is doing it more so. Sami you have some questions here for Alita. So in the competitive sheet I was I mean I've already identified the features for CD configers as well as monitor. Getting it reviewed from PM my guess was or my understanding was that we wouldn't have the same set of competitors that we want to compare to but the right competitors for that particular stage right so for example for for monitor we may not have like a GitHub or something like that we would have monitor based competitors. Or was that the understanding because we identified that entire list of competitors and partners for every single stage. I thought we were going to be using those competitors to compare against so I just wanted your your input on what because I saw some of you have compared with the five competitors already listed over there. So they may not be relevant for example cloud beats may not be relevant for monitor stage at all so that's what I wanted to check it through. Yeah that's the case I need to go back and look at this spreadsheet I mean if the competitor does not apply for that particular stage they shouldn't be on that tab and spreadsheet. So are you saying that you see competitors on that tab for a stage where they don't apply. Yeah I think it was copy pasted each rule has the same. Yeah so each sheet has has a DO at last year in GitHub Jenkins J for all of them cloud these right so that may not be relevant for monitor for configure it would be a different set of competitors that we need to include which I think we already identified a while back I think we identified top three competitors for every stage. Yeah that's when we tiered it right tier one tier two two three so this this where we are right now is we're looking at just tier one competitors that's probably why I cut and paste them because those are all tier ones. So we're just focusing on tier one right now so if they don't apply to that stage don't worry about it make sense. So just pick the ones out of that list that apply to our stage. Right I think we just use the tier one competitors and if they're not if they don't are not applicable then we don't have to fill out anything for that. Yeah for now but then we'll move to tier two and tier three then we'll look at those other. Do we need to add a line item for GitLab as well because I think that's the same over here. Yeah we should add a I think you asked me that before right or someone asked me. I'm just looking at it Brian asked. Yeah we can. Yeah because the way without it you're basically putting all the things that we're better at. Yeah for sure for sure. Yeah right so ideally when we picked like the 10 to 15 features those some of those were like GitLab only some of those were like GitLab didn't have. Well I thought it was supposed to be none of them should be GitLab only right it should be all through the lens of. Yeah yeah exactly yeah it should be like market lens so an ideal world most of them are like this is what I'm shopping for the solution. Some like some of them might be GitLab only some of them might be like competitor only so that it's a somebody would look at it and be like this looks honest and trustworthy and like an accurate assessment of the market. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. And then yeah I think Simon for this just to kind of reiterate for this one we're only doing these five competitors so we'll do the other ones in a later stage and then. For if if the vendor builds like bills themselves as a platform then we should specifically call out that they have zero so GitHub. Bills itself as a platform it sells itself that way. Same with Azure DevOps same with J Frog. Well they all do for tier one except Jenkins and Cloudbees yeah. Yeah Jenkins Cloudbees does not. Yeah right. But what is it you know Azure DevOps GitHub Atlassian and although Atlassians we still need to figure something out there. That is a matter of fact that I go back and add Atlassian because like based on conversation I think we have to do it. I don't think we can leave them off. You know I don't like to look at this version. It is Atlassian is on that sheet. Okay yeah I went back and added them because based on a discussion like my my I wanted to take them off completely and just leave them as a partner but we can't do that. So yeah so for for those platform you know we should call out the fact that they don't have any monitoring. If they have like zero out of 15 we should call that out. Same with configure stuff for this you know any those kind of capabilities. Maybe I think if we took that step further it would be good to even describe it in a way that doesn't just say our product stage and use like a value based description of what monitor and configure mean because otherwise we're just no that's not going to do any good for us. Are you guys seeing the new infographic that the design team has come up with. Yeah yeah. Oh you have it. No. We have a link to that quickly William I don't know. Or you throw it in the notes if you find it. I let's see who can find it faster. You're not with the amount of tabs I have open. I mean oh my god that's what I'm like it probably won't be me. So I this is why I send everything to Google Gmail because the search is so fast so I literally have a folder where all of my GitLab things go and I can just search for infographic. And I found it. I found it. I found it. We could look at first. I found it. I found it. Oh. So this is the one so there's two. This is the one for the single tool comparison but then for the but it's going to look the same but then here's the one for I just put it in chat for you guys. And here's the one for the platform players. So we made it we made a couple decisions along the way so one of the decisions was to just go with stages. It would have been like a whole nother layer of okay if we don't go with just the GitLab stages the 10 stages. What do we use? That has to be determined, reconciled, all this kind of stuff. We kind of I don't know how long it's been since we updated those pages have like not been updated but we kind of are just trying to move towards some sort of towards some progress. I concur that maybe configuring monitors not as descriptive as it could be but the place where it will. So actually I'll share one thing. It just seems like the right time to do this right? Manage is even less descriptive than that. The way this is getting built is off of a data model. In theory these could change or be updated where the underlying data remains the same. We're separating like presentation layer from data layer. So that's it's not going to be as hard to update in the future as it currently is where it's a mess of spaghetti code and it's like really really difficult to update. And then the other component is then not in this iteration we need to get something live but in the next iteration you'll click on verify and it'll go down to the list of the 15 features. And that's where you can describe what the heck of verify is or what the heck I managed. Okay, so we will have an opportunity because I was about to say you're going to hate me for this but like we're. We're being sick of cool about the same problem we had which being the audience coming in and not knowing anything about these specific stages. Yeah, that was one of the big things it's like okay 15 15 features what what is what are they why do I care you know. They're kind of better yeah. To say that means nothing to me looking at this this page. But quick question. Not going to be a Debbie downer. No, we're on top of that. I actually if you read the thread I brought that up but she said we can't do it like right now which I understand. But small thing what do you guys think about the colors. Uh-huh. No, no. I usually let the designers handle that stuff they they. I like. I like the fact that there's no red on that. Oh, you like that. That's what I was going for. Well, you like that. Okay. It's not it's not obviously negative. So we're saying because it really does lend itself to being a comparison more than a competitive piece because of that because there's no you know these folks at 37% are in the red and they're terrible. They just have less green or we would have less green. So that it's not it's not being worse. It's being less good. I think that lends itself to. Working with you know all the co-op petition situations we were talking about. Yeah. Yeah, that's that's a goal is we want we want to generate a helpful asset for the industry. This is not just like marketing shill. This should be like a helpful page. Uh, so it's like yeah the goals have a comparison comparing DevOps tools. Not a you know this is all of our competitors and why we're better. Yeah. Um, I think it's from a competitive mindset. And for me, I'm like, let's go hard. Let's put some rent on there and call. That's just the way I think right. So, but I'm going to stick with the green. They recommended we stick with the green and see how it goes. But I don't know. I was feeling the red and yellow too. So it is easy on the eyes. You know, there's something to be said to that. So. Yeah. Cool. Well, we're almost up on time, but I did want to share one thing that kind of came in. Like, basically Friday. It was like late Thursday for me. So this. This is another thing a lot of these things that don't have like a ton of context on. I just know like we're just trying to up our game. So like, hey, let's move fast and do the best we can do. So this is a little bit of a messaging framework. And then the assignment that was given to me was to fill in these boxes here. So. And then this was the father that I got. So there was these ones that said like from roadmap to company vision, we are transparent. And a single source of truth countless possibilities. Honestly, I think this ones are like really pithy and catchy. I really like it. I really liked what's the other one that I like that not everyone does. All in one for everyone. So I just, I don't know, I like I just think so. There's something catchy about that. But I know that kind of catchy is not everyone's cup of tea. All that's to say is the assignment here was that I took it was to write a pithy few words like punchy statement for each of these three things. So I ended up with a single source of truth countless possibilities. I liked that a lot. This one I went with end to end control over your software factory. Not as pithy but or like not as catchy. But I think. I like it. What's the difference between that slide and the next one that doesn't have anything under security? This was the honestly so that so when I first got this, it didn't have this and it didn't have anything under security. So this is like, it's your iteration of it. Yeah, this is this is mine. This is I just put here so that I would have like the original statements like, you know, automate nearly anything, collaborate on everything. I kind of like that, but I, you know, this one I hate, scale up speed up, test up. I don't think anybody tests up. I think that's really goofy. So hate it. This one I love. That's for me. It's I love it or hate it, right? I love how I love that you're just like bam. So anyway, the what I love in just in five minutes now and then we can kind of end the call is kind of like. Anything that you would change this out for anything that you would change this out for. And then actually let's start here. This one I couldn't pick. And I'll tell you why it's because I like things to have parity in their tone. Right. So this is maybe like super nuanced elements of messaging, but I hate it if it's like a single source of truth that's like in noun phrase and the end control that's like a noun item. So you could say with GitLab, you get a single source of truth with GitLab, you get and the end control. And you can't say with GitLab, you get move fast with confidence. No, but you can say more speedless risk. I like that one the best. I don't like the last one. I agree. That's that's why I put this one at top was for that parity. And then so it sounds like kind of y'all's thoughts are that's that's good as well. Yeah, the only thing it might be missing, but I don't know how we do it without over complicating it is. Well, I guess less risk also implies higher quality. I guess that kind of bundles the quality and the security together. So I've talked myself out of not liking that. So yeah, good. Cindy's last blog post had a really good turn of phrase that I stole for forgive that 14 when she was out. It was like secure the software factory and all the stuff that you're making. She said it really elegant. And it's deliverables. Secure the software factory and it's deliverables. Yeah, I thought it was good to emphasize both because they mean that it's missing. Yeah. Yeah, so you could say secure and control your software factory and it's deliverables. Maybe that would encompass both thoughts. I'm not a big fan of the it's deliverables. Is there a can we say like your software factory and your software or your product product sounds like car manufacturer? I could say IP here, but it just doesn't sound right. And that's always to always short hand. Yeah, I like this one better. Yeah, I think I do too. But but I appreciate the thought. Ryan. Uh, and then the last thing I'll say is so this is this was my first time in the last year. I think this was my attempt to to channel my inner ash withers. Um, I think ash is like super good at just again, just like the catchier, like the turn of phrase element to it. And so like this kind of idea, like single source of truth countless possibilities. Or all in one for everyone, there's something catchy about this. So here I was trying to like envision what is it that we actually give you with this velocity? It's like, it's velocity with confidence is what is what you get. I like your move fast with confidence better than increase speed and stay on track. Yeah, so I was trying to I was thinking of like, you know, if you're like, if you're in a race car and like you go like super super fast, like let's say you're in the bike race, right? And you're going so fast and somebody holds out the sign and then like half of the bike race collapses. It's easier. Right. So it's almost kind of like you can you can keep going like faster and faster and faster. And if somebody like jumps out with a sign in the middle of the racetrack, you're not going to get tripped up by it because Git Labs, you know, it's testing is going to catch that. It's security is going to catch that. All of those elements that allow you to move faster but to do so with confidence. Because otherwise you're like the faster you go, then it gets more dangerous. So trying to encapsulate that in this like that was kind of where I was like stay on track, but I didn't like it either. Did you just open the door for a NASCAR partnership? NASCAR goes fast in terms of left because of Git Lab. You're a new Ricky. So yeah, so I don't think I like that one. And then I think between these two, I like to move fast with confidence, but I don't like the the verbiage of it because it doesn't have parity. So that's where I think. Do you want to add maybe we can add high confidence or more confidence at the end of your first statement. So it kind of combines all of it. So more speed less risk high confidence. But this is kind of overused anyway. Like I see a lot of competitors of vendors using it. I really like the first one. Just more speed less risk. Bam, no trade offs, you know, just this is how it is. Oh, no trade offs. I don't know. That's one of my go-to's. I love that one. This gets into the no trade offs. The engineer in me says, there's never no trade offs. That's like saying like 100% secure. Complete. This is why we always say mitigate, right? We always feel at risk or less risk. You never say no. You never say no. You're late with messaging, right? I mean, not everything, you know. How about just more speed less risk with confidence? What? Yeah. More speed. The Ricky Bobby and me really did like the no trade off. So that's Parker. Yeah. Oh, is that was that from? No, but it could have been. It's something Ricky Bobby would have said. If anyone hasn't seen Telodega nights, they should. That's the homework for this weekend. That's how they ask to come back and we talk about it on Monday and our little social report. I often say thank you little 8 pound 5 ounce baby Jesus with the golden diapers. I say that so often that I just think everybody has seen Telodega nights, but then I realize that people that haven't are like, playing is really weird. Or the next week we'll watch Step Brothers. That's another great one. So much room for activities. Okay. I'm going to go with more speed less risk. And I think this is due at the end of the day. So any additional thoughts. I'm actually going to untag. I mean, strong all those are, you know, cool. Those are good. Awesome. Well, this was kind of fun to do a little bit of like working together session and keep it. Rest with the dance. Keep it rocking. Good to see everybody. See you soon.\n",
